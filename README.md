# ChooseYourOwnAdventure
Task: To create a short Choose Your Own Adventure game using Java Swing and basics of the Java language

Notes: 
- This was created with Java 8 code during my first year of learning Java, but is compiled and built with Java 15 with Maven from JDK 15.
- This project uses the maven-assembly-plugin to build a jar-with-dependencies, which is preferred over the normal jar.

Concepts Covered:
- Data Structures: Arrays
- Variables and Scope: Strings, integers, and objects using public/private notation
- Java Swing: JFrame, JButtons, JTextAreas, JLabels, JScrollPanes
- Comments: Functionality of user-created methods and lines included

Coming soon: 
- A video demoing this project
